Since there has been a lot of talk about mobile app development and how to get started, it seems only fitting that I share my learning process with you &#8212; my students (I know, parallel universe, right?). As usual, I can&#8217;t say how important it is to experiment and play outside of class to build your skills. If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about mobile apps, I encourage you to follow along in my journey. I&#8217;ll continue to update this page as I go through the labs and build appropriate videos for you to follow. The following videos follow <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Android-Boot-Camp-Developers-Using\/dp\/1305857992\">Corinne Hoisington&#8217;s Android Boot Camp, Third Edition<\/a>\u00a0if you&#8217;re interested in picking up the text to learn more on your own.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Step 1: <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.android.com\/sdk\/index.html\">Install the Android Studio<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Step 2: <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.android.com\/tools\/help\/sdk-manager.html#Recommended\">Check\u00a0to make sure everything is installed properly<\/a><\/p>\n<p>A few things I noticed. The Android Studio is a huge download (1.6GB). It takes a bit of time to install and it consumes a chunk of memory when running (about 600MB or more in my experience). The IDE has some nice features. It&#8217;s pretty cool to use a virtual mobile device inside the IDE to test out the app. You can use the emulator to render your app in a virtual device of your choice (Nexus 5, for example). Below you&#8217;ll find videos of each lab so you can see how the development process works from builing the obligatory Hello World! app to integrating audio into the app.<\/p>\n<h4>Lab 1: Voila! Meet the Android<\/h4>\n<p>The first lab will introduce you to the Android Studio IDE and the mobile emulator. A simple Hello World application will be created.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Android Lab 1 - Voila!

Widgets such as TextView, buttons, and ImageView will be used to build the application in conjunction with the strings.xml file and Translations Editor. To do this, a 2nd activity will be created that includes the editing of a new Java class file. To follow along with this lab, an image file is used that can be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.podeschi.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/bruschetta.png\">downloaded<\/a>. The lab will be capped off by testing our new recipe app in the virtual emulator.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Android Lab 2 - Simplify!

I couldn&#8217;t resist finding a hostel in Modena, Italy as I can&#8217;t wait to return to my favorite place to visit (well, besides Disney World!). The Italian countryside is probably the most picturesque places I have seen on this planet. This Android app is a continuation of my post from last week, so consider this practice if you&#8217;ve been following along. The next lesson on the docket includes input from the user, so stay tuned.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Android Youth Hostel App Tutorial\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/4YUf7YH1_MI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h4>Lab 3: Android User Input, Variables and Operations<\/h4>\n<p>In this lab, I incorporate user input, the use of variables in Java, and the use of a spinner as a selection box for the user.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Android Lab 3 - User Input, Variables, and Operations\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/sPox28-YF2I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h4><\/h4>\n<h4>Lab 4: Icons and Decision-Making Controls<\/h4>\n<p>In this lab, I build upon the previous labs and incorporate additional options for the controls, use radio buttons, and use Java and if-else statements to control logic in this weight conversion application.
