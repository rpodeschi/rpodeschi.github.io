I always enjoyed playing video games as a kid, but I haven&#8217;t kept up with the times on newer gaming systems. Having an all-in-one gaming console that allowed me to play vintage games was appealing to me. Ergo, the RetroPie. It&#8217;s a purpose-built Raspbian distribution that includes emulators for all the popular gaming systems from Atari, NES, SNES, and Genesis, to PlayStation, N64, and even Game Cube (who had one of those?). Here was my process to get up and going.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Equipment<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You&#8217;ll need a Raspberry Pi. The nifty $35 motherboard packs a punch, especially the new versions.

Plug in to an existing keyboard and mouse you have laying around and hook it up to your preferred LCD in the house.
